<h4>Core Maths is a new course for Year 12 students that achieve a good pass at GCSE mathematics that's equivalent to an AS level.</h4>
  
<h4>It focuses on using mathematics in a meaningful way to address problems that will be encountered in further studies, work and everyday lives.</h4>
  
<h4>Taught through a practical, problem-solving approach, Core Maths students develop and build valuable mathematics skills using real life examples.</h4>
  
<h4>The course content benefits everyone with future career aspirations, other Level 3 course studies as well as those with higher education ambitions.</h4>
  
<h4>Widely endorsed by employers and universities, from this September every school and college that wants to will be able to offer the Core Maths qualification.</h4>
  
<h4>If you want to continue studying maths, and AS/A level maths isn't for you, ask your school or college about the new Core Maths course.</h4>




Musician
<p>If a DJ wants to keep the crowd on the dance floor, they need a grasp of maths to mix common beats between tracks.  The margin for error is small. Losing count of the beats and dropping the track at the wrong moment can easily ruin the DJs set.</p>

Interior Designer
<p>Whether calculating fabric lengths, planning the design and lay-out of a room or mixing colours in the right proportions, interior designers use the maths of ratios and geometry on a daily basis.</p>

Psychologist
<p>To understand the relationship between how we think, feel and behave, we need the maths of statistics to reveal patterns and trends - and these are what therapists use to find the best way to help their patients.  </p>
 
Forensics Expert
<p>Trigonometry to understand a bullet’s trajectory, calculating matching points between finger print sets, working out the speed and breaking distance at the scene of a car crash – without maths, there would be no forensic experts.</p>

Fashion designer
<p>Fashion is an exciting business and serious mathematics is critical to pattern, design and price points - get it wrong, and the designer won't be designing for long.</p>

Chef
<p>It all looks so easy when the chefs are in the TV studio, but you try guessing the ingredient proportions for chocolate truffles, or the exact cooling temperatures and the mathematical ratios that are key to cooking success.</p>

Artist
<p>Salvador Dali used geometry and John Robinson used topology; fractiles, textiles, tessellations - maths has always featured in great artists' work.</p>
 
Landscape Gardener
<p>Working out the gradient of a garden slope, irrigating a park so that plants and grass grow, calculating when the tilt of that ten meter  tree is beginning to threaten the house beside it…the landscape gardener uses plenty of maths skills too.</p>

Vlogger
<p>Vloggers gauge their popularity by comparing their own subscriber numbers to others, which in turn calculates their influence and celebrity status. Maths can make or break the latest online star.</p>

Weather forecaster
<p>Air pressure.  Wind speed.  Water temperatures.  Just three of the many things that influence the weather.  Deep in the Met Office, mathematical modelling  powers the supercomputers that provide our weather forecasts.  It's harder than it looks in front of that map.</p>
